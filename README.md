# Warpnet Desktop

WarpNet Desktop is a Tauri 2-based Site-Specific Browser (SSB) for the decentralized social network WarpNet.

It embeds a pre-built frontend UI (written in Vue) directly into the desktop application â€” 
no external web servers, no Electron overhead, and no internet required for the interface.
